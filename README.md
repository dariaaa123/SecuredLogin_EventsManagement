### **Spring Framework Web Application**  

#### **Overview**  
This web application is built using the **Spring Framework**, combining a user-friendly interface with a well-structured and scalable architecture. Designed following best development practices, it prioritizes **security, maintainability, and performance**.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Spring Boot** – Accelerates development with an embedded **Tomcat** server.  
- **Spring Security** – Handles **authentication** and **authorization** seamlessly.  
- **JWT Authentication** – Secures API endpoints with token-based authentication.  
- **Database Management** – Supports full **CRUD** operations.  
- **Lombok** – Minimizes boilerplate code in data models.  
- **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)** – Ensures clear separation between application layers.  
- **Service Layer Architecture** – Improves code maintainability and modularity.  
- **Global Exception Handling** – Provides centralized error management.   
- **Environment Configuration** – Manages settings via **application properties**.  
- **Cloud Deployment on Railway** – The database is hosted and deployed on **Railway**.  
- **BCrypt Encryption** – Securely hashes user passwords.  

#### **Technology Stack:**  
- **Spring Boot** – Core framework for rapid development.  
- **Spring Data JPA** – Simplifies database interactions.  
- **Spring Security** – Manages authentication and access control.  
- **MySQL** – Database management system.  
- **Lombok** – Reduces repetitive code.  
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – API security and authentication.  
- **Thymeleaf** – Template engine for UI rendering.  
- **Maven** – Dependency management and build tool.  

#### **Security Implementation:**  
- **BCrypt** – Ensures passwords are securely encrypted.  
- **JWT Authentication** – Protects API endpoints with secure token-based authentication.  
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Restricts access to functionalities based on user roles.  

#### **Deployment:**  
This project is deployed on **Railway**, a cloud-based platform that simplifies hosting and database management while ensuring scalability.
